Coding Challenge.

1 Hour to create app that connects to a third-party api and downloads and displays a list of cats.


*I don't have the exact requirements for the challenge, but the few things I didn't get to implement were..

1. Once you have scrolled all the way to the bottom there should a a loading text which loads next page.
2. UI tweaks.
